  ## Description
  In this project we were asked to create an app that allows the user to keep a todo-type list via a site in their browser. The user will start with a blank page, and can generate as many notes as they would like. Once they have created a few notes, they will be able to delete notes after tasks are completed, and  pull up previous notes if they need to refer back to them. We had to utilize a wide variety of technologies like express.js, node.js, and npm in order for this page to be functional. Since this is our first project that is not a static site, we had to utilize Heroku for final deployment instead of github. 
  ## Installation
  If someone would like to build on this project, they will need to clone the repository and then make sure that they run an npm install on the project repository, and then make sure they install the inquirer package. The beautiful thing about Heroku is that end users do not need to install anything, they can simply access the deployed application link at the top of this readME to access the application, and it will work for them in the browser regardless of whether they have npm installed.  
  ## Usage
  using this app is pretty self explanatory given the UI, however I have added a video below that shows the user how to interact with this page.
